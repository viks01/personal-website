                I am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at 
                <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in">IIIT Hyderabad</a>.
                I am in my first year, and this website was created as part of ISS (Intro to 
                Software Systems) course. 
            </p>

                I enjoy programming and love to learn new things. My interests include reading novels,
                watching movies and I like to play football, table tennis and video games. I listen to 
                music occasionally and also play the piano (beginner level). I find new technologies
                quite fascinating. I like to travel, though I haven't been able to see any new places 
                in the recent past. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm from Bangalore and love the city for it's beautiful weather and vibrancy. No matter where 
                life takes me, I think I'd always love to come back here. This is home.
